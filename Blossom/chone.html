                <p >My thoughts had run to worst-case scenarios as I struggled to balance a backpack, a camera slung over my shoulder, and a cart of suitcases. The airport terminal was filled with cab drivers holding signs reading the names of people I didn’t know and anxious family members holding welcome home signs. As my eyes drifted from eager faces to impatient ones, a bubble of panic started to rise within me. It wasn’t until I set my eyes on a dark, broad-shouldered man in a worn checkered flannel who was struggling to capture my attention as he waved his hands high above his head did I stop and take a deep breath. The bubble burst inside me as I pushed my cart in my Uncle's direction. 
“Welcome to India!” he had exclaimed just like the last time I had seen him and the time before.
Our conversation continued as my Babai pushed the cart up through the airport’s parking lot. A tall balding man, dressed similarly to my Babai, waved his hand as we approached him. 
“The luggage, I will put, you sit in car. You have good journey?” the driver said in broken English as he pointed toward the car. I stifled a giggle before responding.</p>

                <p>“Driver Uncle, Nenu Telugu Matladuthaanu, Journey baaga ayindi,” I speak Telugu, yes, the journey went well. After close to twenty-four hours of traveling, it felt good to breathe in the outdoor air around me. The humid air smelled of a medley of the airport’s outdoor food court and a sleeping city. I settled into the window seat of the car as the driver and my Babai worked to tie the suitcases to the top of the car. I rolled down the windows and closed my eyes. My favorite part of the journey still lay ahead of me: A four-hour drive from the Bangalore Airport to the small town of Pantapalli. After the driver and my Babai settled into their seats, we were off.
“You must be hungry Anni, Pinni has made some snacks for you. Amma told me that you love Pabbillalu and Murukulu,” he said as he offered me an opened tin container of deep fried rice flour chips. 
“Thanks, Babai!” I said as I munched on the flavor-packed rice chips, “Oh my god, these are so good! Amma also makes these back home.”
“Driver Uncle, please, take some snacks, you also must be tired, it is four in the morning!” I said as I handed the container to the driver, “I can promise you, that you have never tasted Murukulu like these!” He chuckled before taking one himself.
“You’re right, even my wife does not make snacks like this, don’t tell her I said that,” he responded as he crunched on the snacks and winked at me through the mirror as I smiled back at him before turning my attention back to my uncle.
“Tell me Babai, what's new?” I asked. 
“Well, not much has changed since you spoke to us before you got on the plane, how are Amma, Nana, and your brother Saish doing?” he asked. 
“They’re all fine, nothing new there. I honestly cannot tell you how excited I am to be able to see everyone after six years. The last time I was here, I was fifteen. So much has happened, and even though I call and talk to all of you, I feel like I have missed so much.” 
“And that’s why you’re here, you have an entire trip ahead of you to make up for all you have missed. Don't think you are the only one who feels that way, we missed seeing you grow up too. Just look at you, all grown up, we all couldn’t be prouder of the young woman you are today.” he said, holding up my chin. “That's why everyone is excited when any of you come home." he said, as he gave me a soft smile. </p>

                <p>After a moment of silence, he turned to me “I am going to close my eyes for a bit, don’t hesitate to wake me up if you need anything. You should also sleep, I don’t know how much you slept on the plane ride here. I know that the car isn’t very comfortable, but try and get some rest at least. Everyone is eagerly waiting for you at home, and they won’t let you rest once we reach." he said as I smiled. "We’ll stop and get breakfast in an hour or two.” he said as he pressed his head against the tattered seat and dozed off. I closed my eyes and rested my head against the window as I breathed in the organic air that flooded into the car.
I looked out the window thinking of all the cousins who grew up before I had a chance to hold them, the grandparents I had only met once or twice before they left for a place they would never return from, and the memories I hadn’t had the opportunity to make with my family. You’re here now, make the most of it, I reminded myself as I opened my eyes and watched the streets pass by. There was a certain moment when the city’s atmosphere faded away and was replaced by the incense of earthy roads that lay beneath and a sense of calmness not found in the city.
It was around six in the morning now, and the villages and towns we passed through slowly came to life. Mothers in nightgowns ran back and forth trying to pack lunches for their husbands and children while they tackled a tangled mess of their daughter’s long hair, trying to tie it up into braids for school. The fresh morning was filled with chatter as some eyed our vehicle that passed by. I found it interesting how even though my parents immigrated to America twenty-three years ago, my mornings had been filled with the similar bustling I observed through the window. My mom, who I called Amma, always woke up before the rest of us, took a shower, and completed her Pooja before dragging my brother and I out of bed. As my brother and I got ready for school, she would make a steaming hot cup of coffee for my dad, prepare a hearty breakfast, and would pack lunches for all of us while we ran around trying to find everything for the day. After all of us left for school, and my dad went to work, she would make herself a cup of coffee and would sit in her favorite chair near the window that overlooked our garden. I smiled to myself as I waved to the children who reminded me of my younger self. 
As we passed by the villages, One woman who stood in a brightly colored saree caught my eye as she reached for a broom and swept the dust that had accumulated overnight in front of her doorstep. She scooped her hands into a copper vessel and splattered water all over the surface and then began. Bending down, she scooped white flour into her hand and slowly released small amounts to form a pattern of dots. She then looped the dots into families by drawing lines between them. As she stepped away, a larger pattern emerged; she began to smile. It wasn't the first time I had seen someone draw this pattern of dots and lines. My mom would create similar designs with a piece of chalk whenever we celebrated festivals such as Diwali. Amma had explained to me that the ritual of drawing a muggu in front of a home every morning was a symbol of family. </p>
	
   <p> "No matter how far one dot is from another, it will always be looped into the pattern. Remember, no matter how far you venture, those lines of relationships you build will always tie you to this family." she had said to me. On trips to India, my own muggu would expand with every new relative I met; the lines connecting me to known relatives strengthened. However, just as a muggu fades, so did my relationships with my family. On leaving day, I would wipe away my tears, making empty promises to keep in touch and call every week. Each empty promise worked as an eraser on the lines I had built with my family. I felt tears well up in my eyes before I caught the driver's glance in the mirror and smiled back.
"Everything ok? You look deep in thought," he said.
"Ya Uncle, I'm just tired from my journey," I said trying to keep a steady voice as he smiled a little. 
"My younger daughter is in sixth grade. She wants to grow up and go somewhere foreign like you!” he said in Telugu. "Maybe in a couple of years, I will be picking her up from the airport, taking her home," he said, as I watched pride gleam in his eyes. I smiled and nodded not knowing how to respond. 
“I’m kind of hungry, can we stop somewhere for breakfast?” 
“There is a Dosa place nearby, we can stop there, wake your Babai, he must be hungry too. We started from home at midnight and he was so eager to receive you at the airport, he didn't sleep a wink.” He said as he looked at him through the mirror. 
At the Dhaba, the waiter brought me a hot plate of Dosa with a side of Sambar and Chutney. We were all hungry and ate in silence. Although the Dosas were not crispy enough, the Sambar too liquidy, and the Chutney too salty, I said nothing as I stuffed my mouth with something that could cure my hunger. 
My mom's cooking on the other hand was perfect and was popular among my friends and guests. Every time someone sat down for a meal at my place, they always left with a protruding belly and never-ending praise for my mom’s food. 
“Do you like the Dosa?” My Babai asked. 
“It’s alright. But, never would I eat it like that!” I exclaimed as I pointed to the atrocity my Babai was committing. He tore a piece off the Dosa and dipped it into the sambar and then into the chutney before placing it in his mouth. In my eyes, this was the equivalent of eating fries dipped in a mix of ranch and ketchup.
“Oh come on, this is the real secret to enjoying Dosa properly!” he responded grinning as I vigorously shook my head. 
“No, that’s disgusting,” I said as we shared a chuckle.
“Do you want a cup of coffee?” Babai asked me.
“I don’t drink coffee,” I said. The only exception to this was my mom’s coffee. Every once in a while she would make a special kind of filter coffee that tasted better than any drink Starbucks could ever brew up. Gosh how much I missed her and her cooking. I had just completed my third year in college, and instead of going back home after finals, I decided to fly straight to India. I found tickets in the first week of June and quickly booked them. Before I knew it I was sitting in an airplane ready to fly half away across the world on my own. I was so glad that in a couple of weeks, my mom, dad, and brother would also be coming to India.</p>

    <p> It wasn’t long before we drove into the village that resembled the one I had remembered visiting when I was younger. 
Although Pantapalli had changed since the last time I was here, the village’s spirit remained evergreen. The increase in rainfall in recent years has led to a successful crop year. Palm trees waved in the warm breeze of the mid-morning and bright green rice paddies decorated small reservoirs of water. Nature seemed to welcome the monsoon season with a festivity of its own. Many of the small houses had been replaced by larger two-story concrete buildings that were painted vibrantly. Men in worn white shirts, lungis, a cotton cloth wrapped around the waist that extended to the ankle, and a towel wrapped around their heads walked on the side of the road herding their cows to their respective fields. The cows here did not Moo like they did back home, instead, they bellowed a long Ambaa as we drove past them. After a long journey, we finally arrived. The colorfully painted concrete house sat in the middle of our small farmland. To the right of the house was a small shed where the cows were housed. 
As soon as the car drove up to the house, cousins came running out of the gates, flinged open the SUV doors and tackled me into a hug. “We missed you so much! Welcome to India!” they said as they squeezed me tight. “I missed you all too!” I said as I threw my arms around them. Six years, I thought to myself, how did six years go by since the last time I was here? I had promised myself to never forget the memories, to never forget the relationships I spent a summer building. How many of those promises had I kept?
I stepped onto the concrete platform that surrounded the house and looked up to see an eager crowd, their warm smiles radiating down the walkway. As I walked toward the house, Lilly, my aunt’s dog, welcomed me with a loud “Woof Woof!”. My aunt struggled to not fall over as Lilly rushed toward me and dragged my aunt with her. 
“Lilly! How are you, I know, I know, I missed you too!” I exclaimed as she tackled me into a hug and gave me a wet kiss. I stood up and saw my grandparents, my Attas, Mamas, Annas, Akkas, Pinnis, Babai, and so many other family members standing in front of me grinning. The ground had been decorated with a beautiful muggu that spelled out Welcome Home Anamika! 
The muggu had been drawn largely with flowers decorating the dots and lines. This time, no empty promises. I am the artist of my muggu. I will learn to redraw these lines and make them permanent. I thought to myself as I looked up to see my cousin approaching me with a plate in her hand.  It was custom that anytime someone arrived from a long journey, they were to be welcomed into the home after an Aarati, a ritual where a camphor piece is set on fire and circled in front of someone, to get rid of Dhishti, the evil eye. After the Aarati had finished, I approached my grandparents and bowed in front of them touching my fingers to their feet before moving my hands towards my eyes as they blessed me. A round of hugs was exchanged, and suitcases were unloaded from the car with the help of everyone around me. After taking a deep breath, I finally took a step inside the house that I would learn to call home. This was the beginning of my Indian Summer.</p>
