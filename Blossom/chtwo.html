                <p> I tossed and turned and tried to fall asleep for what felt like the twentieth time. It was 1:00 in the morning, but mentally, it was 2:30 in the afternoon. It had been two days since we arrived at the place my parents grew up in, and I still hadn’t adjusted to the time difference. My aunts, uncles, and cousins who welcomed us had gone back to the city for the week and would return this Friday. The humid air around me over powered the small fan that turned in circles above my head. My head rested on a stiff rock-like pillow as I lay on my back counted the number of times the fan went in circles. You were supposed to be spending the summer completing an internship, shooting hoops, and road tripping. I thought they said we were planning on going to Hawaii this summer? At least the hotel there would have air conditioning. I thought to myself. It wasn’t fair, I was a senior in college, and I wasn’t even allowed to make plans for how I wanted to spend my summer. This was embarrassing. 
                ✵</p>

                 <p>  had been home for spring break the day they broke the news. My dad had made his famous chicken biryani and was serving the rice into each of our plates. Likitha, my younger sister, and I were in an intense conservation over who would win the last game in the March Madness bracket this year. As I loaded my mouth with the biryani, my mom gave my dad alook.
                “What is it? I know that look,” I asked looking between my parents. I tried to hide my smile as I looked between them. The last time I had called my mom, I had heard my dad in the background announcing that he had booked tickets before my mom turned to shush him. We had been talking about going to Hawaii for years, and I had been so confident that this summer, I would be sipping fresh coconut water as I relaxed on a beach chair on a clear, blue ocean front. 
                “You haven't  told him yet?” My mom asked.
                “I thought you would tell him.” My dad responded.
                “Will one of you please tell me?” I asked eagerly. 
                “We -” my dad started before my sister cut in. 
                “We’re going to India this summer, from the middle of June to July.” My sister blurted out.
                “You’re so funny.” I said as I looked at her and gave her a smile. “You know Mom and Dad, if you really wanted to keep Hawaii a secret, you have to try a bit harder. The last time I was here, you were looking through Costco Travels for a trip to Hawaii.” I looked up at my parents who seemed confused.
                “Chandra Akka is getting married in July, we’re going to India for the wedding.” my sister said. 
                “Come on, guys, I hate to ruin the surprise, but I know.” There was a moment where my parents and my sister exchanged a muddled look before my mom spoke. 
                “Pranav, you’re sister’s right, I don’t know why you think we’re going to Hawaii this summer.” my face dropped as I looked up at my parents, “But -”
                “We were initially thinking Hawaii, but both your mom and I both got extended leaves this summer, it was a perfect opportunity for an India trip. Besides, it’s been five years since we last went.” my dad said. 
                
                “But if we’re going in July, I have to cancel my road trip? There’s no way. Aw, come on dad, I see Rahul, Ethan, and Jayden only during the summer ‘cause we all go to different colleges.”
                “You have a couple of weeks before we go and some time after we come back to spend with them.”
                “We had a whole road trip planned out and-” 
                “You’re coming with us, and that’s final. You can spend time with your friends anytime, family comes first. It’s time you learned that Pranav.” he responded in a stern voice, ending a discussion before it even started. 
                “At least you could’ve told me a little earlier, I have an internship this summer too.” I mumbled as I shoved a spoon of biryani into my mouth.
                “Calm down ra, We only confirmed the trip a couple of days ago. Since your internship is virtual, you can work from India. There is no need for you to get so upset. We thought you would be excited to go to India, it’s been a while since you’ve seen everyone. Maybe you just need some time to think about how fun the trip will be. ” My dad said as he raised a handful of biryani to his mouth. “The biryani came out perfect this time kadaa ?” he said, eyeing Liki and my mom who nodded.  Two months later, I packed my suitcase, and we flew to India. 
                ✵ </p>

                <p>
                    After tossing and turning for another two hours, I heard the sound of someone moving about the house. I reached my hand to the small wood stool where my phone was charging and tapped it to check the time. 5:00 A.M.. Why would anyone be up at this time? I rolled out of bed and stepped over the straw rug Liki was sleeping on. I stuck my head outside of the bedroom door to see the front door open. The dirt road that led to the entrance of the house was dimly lit by a flickering lamp post. A woman stood in a bright color saree wrapping her fraying hair into a bun. She reached for a broom and swept the dust that had accumulated overnight. She scooped her hands into a copper vessel and splattered water all over the surface and then began. Bending down, she scooped white flour into her hand and slowly released small amounts to form a pattern of dots. She then looped the dots into families by drawing lines between them. As she stepped away, a larger pattern emerged; she began to smile. I stepped closer to my Nanamma to get a better view of what she was smiling at. It wasn’t the first time I had seen a similar formation of dots and lines. On special occasions like Diwali and Sankranti my mom would draw a pattern similar to this on our front porch using a piece of chalk. 
                “Good Morning” I said as I approached her. She jumped and quickly turned around. 
                 “Oh Pranav, it’s you. What are you doing snooping around like that trying to scare your old grandmother?” She said as she put a hand to heart and took a deep breath.
                “Jeez, didn’t mean to scare you, I just couldn’t sleep ‘cause of jet lag, and then I heard sounds coming from outside, so I just came out to take a peek. I didn’t think you would jump like that” I said.  
                “It’ll take a couple of days. It takes me a couple of days to adjust to the time here after I come and visit you in America too.” she said as she returned the cup of flour to the window sill. “Since you are awake, go brush your teeth, and you can help me with something. Afterwards, I will make you a nice cup of coffee.” She said, as her face softened into a smile. 
                After I brushed my teeth, I followed my Nanamama to a small shed made of a thin sheet of metal propped up on sticks supporting it on all sides. Under the shed stood two cows, one black and the other with a sandy colored coat, chewing on fresh hay. My Nanamma placed a flat rock under the tan cow before placing a tin pot on the surface. 
                “This is Parvati, she gives us the most amount of milk, '' she said as she removed a small oil jar from the tin pot and greased the cow's udder. With each pull milk darted into the tin pot making a tingling sound each time it hit the pot. Before long, the tin pot was half full. She turned to me and asked if I wanted to give it a try. I shook my head. You couldn’t pay me a million to touch the slimy udder of a cow. I thought.
                “You have to have lots of muscles, but you are skinny as a stick because you don’t eat at all. I’ll feed you well, maybe by the end of the summer you’ll be strong enough” She said as she challenged me. 
                “I bench press 170 pounds, that's like close to 80 kilograms, this would be nothing.” 
                
            </p>
                
            
                <p> “Then what’s the problem? My Raja is scared of cows, or is it that you Americans are too clean for this kind of work?” She asked calling me her special nickname. 
                “I’m not scared of cows. You know what? Fine, what do I have to lose?” I replied as I squatted down. 
                “Ok, you’re going to have to move closer now. Don’t get scared if the cow moves its foot. You can calm her down by just saying ‘ooo oooo’ and running your hand against the side of her leg, just like this.” She said as she demonstrated. “Ok, Pull down and aim into the tin pot. Give it a try” She said as she stood up and moved back.
                I gulped nervously as I moved towards the cow and hesitated before grabbing a hold of the udder. It wasn’t slimy, instead, it was cool and the oil my grandmother had applied to the udder made it slippery. Aiming into the tin pot, I pulled. The thinnest stream of milk made its way into the pot.
                 “Pull harder, don’t worry.”  My Nanamma advised. I pulled harder and a thin stream of milk found its way into the pot below the udder. “Told you it wasn’t hard! I already got the hang of it.” I exclaimed looking back at my grandmother. She stood gleaming at me as I alternated hands. When I turned back to the udder, I was met with a sharp slap from Parvathi’s tail. 
                “Oh Shit!” I screamed and backed away as I spit out hair that was stuck in my mouth. Startled, Parvathi turned around and almost stepped on my foot. I scrambled up and took a step backwards. My Nanama chuckled loudly as she ran a hand across Parvathi’s side. 
                “Ooooo Parvathi. Oooo. He doesn’t know you, no need to scare him” She said, petting her side. I could have sworn that Parvathi snickered at me. 
                “Gaa!! You see why I said no?” I said standing a cautious distance from both the cows. Reason two for why Hawaii would’ve made a better trip, no cows, no getting wacked in the face. I thought as my Nanama bent down and continued milking her until the tin pot was filled.
                “You did pretty good, just have to stay focused. You’re too quick with claiming success, it takes time.” she said. 
                </p>

                <p>
                I stood as far back as I could before looking back at me.“You should have seen your face, you looked like you saw a ghost.” She went on laughing as I sped back to the front of the house. As I entered the small house, I saw that Liki had woken up. 
                “Good Morning, what you doing up so early? You’re usually out until at least 11.” She said, shooting me a puzzled look. “What’s up with your face? It's the color of a ripe tomato.”
                I glared at her “Good Morning is the worst possible way to sum up getting whacked in the ass by a cow's tail.” I mumbled as I washed my hands and grabbed my phone. I scrolled through Insta and found a new post of my friends on their road trip. Ayyo Pranav, u missin the time of a lifetime my dude read the caption. I shook my head and was about to respond when I saw my Nanamma enter the kitchen.
                “Pranav, come here for a second, I need your help with something.” She called.
                “As long as you don’t send me back to the cows” I pleaded.
                “No cows, just a quick errand.” She said, with a smirk on her face that internally laughed about the incident.  “I just need a lighter because the stove we have isn’t working, can you go next door and ask Pramilla auntie for one.” 
                “Sure.” Back home I would run similar errands for my mom. Whether it was for a bag of onions, Idli rice, or just for some pachadi, my mom would send me to different aunties houses to grab something and we would return the favor. I walked next door and stood and rang a newly installed door bell. A girl who looked my age opened the door. 
                “ Hi, I’m Pranav. I came for a lighter for the kitchen stove. My Nanamma sent me.” I said.
                “Are you the American from next door?” she asked as her eyes grew larger and she tilted her head. 
                “Um, ya. Do you have a lighter?” I asked again.
                “My aunt’s in the kitchen, she can probably help you.” she said as she led me to the kitchen.
                “Pramilla Atta? Malleswari Nanamma needs a lighter. She sent her…grandson.” the girl said before walking back into a bedroom.
                “Pranav? My god how much you have grown! Please come, sit na?” the skinny woman in the orange saree said. As she turned around, her long braid spun and hit her back as she smiled at me warmly.
                “Hi auntie, I can’t, Nanamma actually needs the lighter right now. I’ll come back some other time” I replied. 
                “Aah, ok then, here.” she said, placing a lighter in my hand.
                “Thank you, I’ll return it once she is done using it.”

                </p>
                <p>
                    “Don’t worry, I won’t need it today, that is a spare one I keep. You speak Telugu nicely for a boy who grew up in America.” She said as she led me back to the door. “Do come back with your family for lunch sometime, it has been so long since me and your mom have talked. We were good friends back when we were in high school.” she said as she turned to me.
                    “Sure.” I said as I headed back to my Nanamma’s house. A small wall surrounded the house with a gate out front. 
                     “Thank you ra.” my Nanamma chided as I handed her the lighter. “Just give me a couple of minutes, I’ll make you a nice cup of coffee.”
                        I took a seat across from the kitchen on the mancham. The cot made from weaving cloth back and forth felt like a large bungee chair. As I bounced up and down, I watched the  small village come to life. Roosters cockaracooed and the cows bellowed a low ambaa. My Ammama walked out of the kitchen holding a steaming steel tea glass. 
                    “Here you go, Pranav. A hot cup of coffee.” she said as she handed me a small steel cup. 
                    “Thanks Nanamma,” I said as I lifted the glass to my lip. “Mmm, this tastes so good.” I said to my grandmother who beamed. 
                    “That’s the taste of your hard work.” she said, still reminiscing about the morning catastrophe. I shook my head. I had to admit, the fresh milk made all the difference, making the coffee silkier and flavor more prevalent. 
                    “Oh, come on Nanamma, can’t we just forget today morning? I just want to enjoy my coffee.” I said as she smiled and went back into the kitchen. My parents had also woken up and were getting ready for the day. They had wanted to go to the local temple this morning and were racing around getting ready and gathering items for the pooja. Children from the village had also woken up and were getting ready for school. Some kids who looked my age walked past our house and waved at me. I sat sipping coffee and looking out into the village hoping that I would find something to do this summer. Sure, I had an internship to work on, and my sister would be around, but there was no way that was going to fill up my time. The village was no Hawaii, no bright blue ocean, no trying new food at a resort, just baking in the heat. Maybe I could meet some kids here my age and we could play cricket, I thought to myself. There had to be something fun to do here, well, that is something that didn’t include cows.
